"""Shared failure classification and retry backoff for GitHub CLI calls.

Keeping the retry decisions here rather than in one caller means every ``gh``
wrapper shares the same rules: rate limits always fail fast, transient
infrastructure failures can retry, and all other errors are final.
``scripts.gh.gh_runner`` is the current consumer; the CI workflow helpers
adopt it when they gain a ``gh api`` wrapper of their own.
