"""Prune local branches whose content already exists in the base branch.

The old recipe listed candidates with ``git for-each-ref --merged``, which is a
pure ancestry test. Under a squash-merge workflow that test can never fire: a
squash merge replays the branch as one new commit on the base, so the original
branch tip is not an ancestor of the base and ``--merged`` never lists it. The
target was effectively a no-op, and merged branches accumulated locally.

This helper asks the question that actually matters instead: would merging the
branch into the base change the base at all? ``git merge-tree --write-tree``
answers it entirely in the object store, without touching the working tree or
the current checkout. An identical tree means the branch contributes nothing
and is safe to drop. A different tree, or a merge conflict, means the branch
may hold work that exists nowhere else, so it is reported and kept rather than
deleted.

Deletion uses ``git branch -D``. ``-d`` applies the same ancestry test that
failed above and would refuse every squash-merged branch, so the force flag is
required; the tree comparison is the stronger guarantee that makes it safe.

The Makefile forwards two inputs through the environment:

- ``PRUNE_MAIN_BRANCH``: the base branch name, never deleted.
- ``PRUNE_CONFIRM``: ``1`` deletes; anything else reports and exits.
